Question:

Consider a web application where users can add items to a shopping list. Write JavaScript code to implement the following functionality:

When the user clicks the "Add Item" button, a new list item (<li>) should be created.
Inside the list item, there should be a text node displaying the name of the item entered by the user in an input field.
The input field should clear after the item is added to the list.
Each list item should have a "Remove" button that allows the user to remove the item from the list when clicked.
When the "Remove" button is clicked, the corresponding list item should be removed from the DOM.
Your solution should use document.createElement, setAttribute, addEventListener, and removeChild methods appropriately.

Hint: You can use the parentNode property of an element to identify the parent element and remove it from the DOM.

This question covers the following concepts:

Creating elements dynamically with document.createElement.
Setting attributes with setAttribute.
Adding event listeners with addEventListener.
Removing nodes from the DOM with removeChild.
Manipulating text nodes.
It tests the candidate's understanding of how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and their ability to create interactive web interfaces.
